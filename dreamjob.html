      <h2>Digital Business Technical Analyst</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h3>The Position:</h3>
      <p>The Digital Business Technical Analyst is responsible for the identification and resolution of technical issues identified through their work. Furthermore, their role is instrumental in the communication and support of change endeavours, including communication and work with  vendors to ensure satisfactory outcomes for all stakeholders. Finally, the position is responsible for ensuring that QA is met and expectations are clear and documented. <br>This position is appealing notably due to its conformance to my goals and interest in Information Technology. The ability to be involved in the widescale specification, development, rollout and support of a large IT project that brings about change or supports emerging technologies in a business such as McDonalds would be a worthwhile and brilliant position.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skillsandquals">
      <h3>Skills and Qualifications:</h3>
      <p>This position requires two years of previous experience in a similar role and a tertiary qualification in the IT field. Furthermore, the position is listed as requiring attention to detail and strong skills in business documentation and troubleshooting skills. Furthermore, it notes the benefit of experience with software such as Jira and marketing and CRM solutions.<br> At the present time, I have opportunities to develop the technical aspects of the required skills and qualifications, namely the tertiary qualifications and technical skills and experiences. However, in regards to the attention to detail and troubleshooting skills, in addition to team and strong relationship skills, I believe that through my current and ongoing work within the McDonalds organisation, including McDonalds courses, I will have developed these skills sufficiently by the completion of this degree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pathway">
      <h3>Pathway Forward:</h3>
      <p>By continuing within my franchise with a committed licensee I have already had the opportunity to progress and learn skills essential to the position. Furthermore, through the networking with current IT professionals within the McDonalds organisation, I have established relationships that will enable a transition through the restaurant level in the next 5-7 years and then into a corporate role, to develop the final required skills and experiences internally. This pathway is both advertised and proven to occur within the organisation.</p>
