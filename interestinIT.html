      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <h3>The beginning of my interest in IT:</h3>
      <p>I have had an interest in Information Technology for nearly as long as I can remember, although there are a few principle moments that are discernible throughout my journey with IT.</p>

    <div class="utility">
      <h2>First, the utility</h2>
      <p>It would have been in Grade 1 at school when the school implemented its first technology. The first wave included a dozen desktop computers and a smart board. I can vividly remember the first time our class used this magical technology and how it changed the way we worked and learnt. This theme carried through all secondary education and was paramount in 2020 as learning went digital. The fundamental point of interest remained however, technology revolutionised the way we worked and provided a utility previously unavailable (and meant no more hand written reports!)</p>

    <div class="posibilities">
      <h2>Second, the posibilities</h2>
      <p>After my first experiences with technology came a seemingly innocuous day. A simple task, fiddling with a weather widget, gave way to exploration, modification and customisation. It seems simple and unoriginal in hindsight, but the feeling of being able to create something, anything to be what I dreamed it could be gave a sense of challenge and learning that I have forever embraced and cherished. </p>

    <div class="mypassion">
      <h2>My IT Passion</h2>
      <p>These two occurrences formed the underlying foundation of my experience with IT. In 2018, my passion for IT went from a cool hobby and a future profession when I had the opportunity to attend NCIS at the University of Sydney and then again in 2019 when I had the opportunity to return again. It was during this time that I formalised what my interest in IT is: <br> Leveraging technology to change the way we conduct business and to bring successful change for stakeholders.</p>

          <p id="text1">It is my intention to complete this subject as part of the Information Technology degree at RMIT to learn the essentials to transition into a career IT, specifically the roll out of large IT projects in a business environment. If this course provides me with the skills and knowledge, I need to bring about change centred around IT, that positively impacts businesses and or individuals, I will consider it a success.</p>
          <p id="text2">As highlighted in the Personal Profile, I am currently employed full time as a shift manager at McDonalds and am engaged with ongoing development and promotions within the restaurant. Given the opportunities being afforded to me there, and the role they can play in a streamlined entrance into McDonald’s IT, it no longer seemed prudent to relocate to Melbourne and start over. This obviously, came after the original decision to attend RMIT. I have to travel a distance to attend University anyway, so why not take the leap to somewhere great!</p>
